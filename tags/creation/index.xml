      <description>The picture language framework in SICP provides capabilities to create visually satisfying creative pictures, all built on top of a very simple concept - drawing a line between two points.
Spending some time with it, I came across some interesting patterns and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to welcome you to the picture language grand exhibit.
ENTRY Exhibit 1 - Solos square-limit-with-outline-painter Notes: This picture helps clearly understand the &amp;lsquo;square limit&amp;rsquo; pattern described in the book.</description>
