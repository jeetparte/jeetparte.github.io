      <description>If you type the home row keys of the QWERTY layout into Spotlight Search twice, Siri understands that you are touch typing and suggests a relevant page from Wikipedia.
Steps to reproduce  Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re connected to the internet. Type asdfjkl;asdfjkl; into Spotlight Search.  (TODO - I want to add the image here. Figuring out how to do that in Hugo.)</description>

      <description>At work this week, I discovered a quirk in the .NET API.
An ArgumentException is thrown when one of the arguments to a method is invalid. A more specific ArgumentException is an ArgumentNullException which (as you may have guessed) is thrown when an argument is invalid because it is null.
The funny thing is that while the base class provides this constructor -
public ArgumentException (string message, string paramName);  the one provided by the derived class is -</description>

      <description>A quick update about this site - I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of setting it up so that it&amp;rsquo;s just as I&amp;rsquo;d want (or failing that, till all the essentials are met).
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m working on -
 On the technical side, I need to get this site deployed. (It wasn&amp;rsquo;t when I wrote this!). I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo - the static site generator. Also, need to enable comments so that we can talk to each other :P Importantly, I want this site to be organized so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to navigate and view related content.</description>

      <description>This blog was created as a medium for exploring the world of code from a creative perspective. &amp;ldquo;Creative&amp;rdquo; here refers to original ideas and new endeavours.
Most content here will relate in some way to software development and code. However, since nothing exists in a bubble, I like to think that the most valuable ideas in computing will be those that take into account its interconnectedness with the larger world. Conceived with that in mind, you will find that as a whole, the explorations in this blog are holistic and seek to encompass a larger range of topics.</description>
